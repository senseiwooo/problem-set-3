        <td>1972</td>
        <td>Fischer was the first American chess player to become world champion since Paul Morphy in the 19th century.
          He managed to defeat the entire team of Soviets which had dominated the chess scene for many decades. Soon after
          becoming world champion, he retired from chess and spend the rest of his life in solitude. He was one of the best
          players to ever grace the game and created many brilliancies in his time.
