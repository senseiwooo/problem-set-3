      How to Play
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
      Many people think that chess is a complicated game that can only be played by smart people.
      However, this simply is not true, and you can learn how to play chess in just a few minutes.
      <br>
      Chess is a game played by two players sitting opposite each other. The pieces are set up as shown from white's side.
      The pieces from the bottom row and from left to right are: the rook, the knight, the bishop, the queen, the king, another bishop,
      another knight, and another rook. In the second row, there are only pawns. In total, one side has 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops,
      1 queen, and 1 king. As shown, black's pieces are set in the same fashion paralle to white's. White moves first.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The Board
    </h3>
    <p>
      Chess is played on an 8 x 8 board totaling 64 squares. The 64 squares alternate between light and dark squares.
      In order to refer to the different squares on the board individually, chess players use a notation system. The rows
      are labelled using numbers 1-8 from top to bottom. And the files (columns) are labelled using letters from A-H from left to right.
      This board orientation is shown from white's perpective.

    <h3>
      Moving the pieces
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that you have an understanding of the position of the pieces and of the board, it is time to learn how to actually move
      the pieces.
